    <h3>What type of connections can I use this app for?</h3>
    <p>Anything. It is completely up to you what intention you have in broadcasting. This is a platform only to support your desire to connect with others. So you may use it, for example, for dating, coworking, spontaneous jam session meetups, or anything else that includes connecting with others.</p>
    <p>It basically allows you to look around your area.. see all the things people are doing, and if you want company and see something interesting, then to join in!</p>
